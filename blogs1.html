                <h3>How to Spot Changes in Your Student’s Mental Health</h3>
                <p>Recently released numbers from the CDC show that the number of students suffering from persistent sadness or hopelessness fell from 42% to 40% between 2021 and 2023.

                    “This may seem like a small shift, but in terms of the numbers we’re talking about, that means roughly 840,000 fewer U.S. students are suffering now than they were in 2021,” says Dr. Michael Olla, a psychiatrist at Valley Spring Recovery, a premier addiction treatment center. 
                    
                    “However, youth mental health is still an ongoing and major problem in the USA, so it’s important to spot the signs of mental health issues early to effectively intervene. Look out for these five signs of poor mental health in kids, and approach a health professional if you do spot them.”</p>
